# Twitter-Classification-Project

K-Neighbors Classifier and Naive Bayes Classifier Machine Learning techniques used in this project. 

Information provided by CodeCademy in json files, and also in two Jupyter Notebook files where I put up my code.

The viral tweets file was used to conduct analysis with K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier, while the location tweets was used to conduct analysis with the Naive Bayes Classifier.
